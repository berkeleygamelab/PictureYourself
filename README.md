PictureYourself
===============

# Project Description
The Picture Yourself application uses visual storytelling practices like the "selfie" to help improve college access and provide students with a tool for navigate the college process. 

# Setup

## To run this app locally: 

- Make sure Ruby is installed 
- Open terminal and navigate to the PictureYourself root folder
- Run: 'bundle install'
- When gems are all installed, run: 'shotgun picture_yourself.rb'

# To contribute to this app:

- Create a branch with 'git checkout -b <name of branch>'
- Then submit a pull request with 'git push origin <name of branch>'
- Have another team member review your code before either of you merge with the master branch

# Troubleshooting: 
Occasionally, closing shotgun (Control-C) will hang, causing the port to be unusable in the future.
To fix this, run shotgun -p <port number> picture_yourself.rb

# Form:
- use spaces (!not tabs!) for indentation
- write descriptive commit messages

# Orientation:
