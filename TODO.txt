Minor:
    Get a new, higher res logo image (the image in the top left corner of the navbar)
    Get more text images

These shouldn't be too difficult:
    Fix timeout, and timeout dialog boxes
    Add/expand on error handling. Currently, some exists, but is very poor, 
        usually just alerting the user that "Something went wrong"
    Figure out a way to allow user to take more images from the webcam 
        without having to reallow Chrome access. Issue might be with way 
        the webcam access is coded.

Unknown difficulty:
    Add animations to the toolbox drawers when they open and close. Require
        AngularJS animations (I think), which I'm not sure how to use.

Hard:
    Replace KineticJS with some other canvas library, since KineticJS is no longer supported.
